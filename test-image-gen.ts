  /**

- No text, words, letters, signs, labels, or speech bubbles anywhere
`.trim(),

  /**

  /**
   * Bitcoin agent doing something mundane — tests our core visual identity
   */
  singlePanel: {
    scene: `A small robot wearing a Bitcoin orange hard hat sits at a tiny desk,
reviewing an enormous stack of papers labeled with checkmarks. The robot looks
exhausted, slumped in its chair. A coffee mug sits nearby, empty. Behind the
robot, a massive server rack hums with blinking lights. The contrast between
the tiny, tired robot and the massive infrastructure it manages is the visual gag.`,
    composition: `Rule of thirds — robot at left-third intersection, server rack
fills the right two-thirds. Eye travels: tired robot → empty mug → enormous
paper stack → looming servers. Low camera angle makes the servers feel even
more imposing relative to the small robot.`,
  },

  /**
   * Two characters in dialogue — tests multi-character consistency
   */
  dialogueScene: {
    scene: `Two developers at a whiteboard. Developer A (tall, wearing a Stacks
hoodie, wild curly hair, round glasses) is enthusiastically drawing an
impossibly complex architecture diagram that has spiraled across the entire
whiteboard and onto the wall. Developer B (short, neat polo shirt, skeptical
expression, arms crossed) stares at the diagram with visible concern. A small
potted plant on the desk has started wilting, implying they've been at this
for hours.`,
    composition: `Developer A at left, leaning toward whiteboard with marker
extended. Developer B at right, leaning back with crossed arms. Whiteboard
between them, covered in chaotic lines and arrows. The wilting plant is a
small background detail in the lower right. Strong diagonal energy from
Developer A's enthusiasm vs Developer B's resistance.`,

   * Strip panel test — one panel from a sequence
   */

    scene: `A confident AI agent (depicted as a sleek, chrome robot with a
briefcase) walks into a boardroom full of old-fashioned bankers in suits.
The bankers look startled, some dropping their papers. The AI agent has a
name tag that would say "Agent #47" but remember — NO TEXT in the image.
The contrast is between the futuristic robot and the stuffy, traditional
banking environment. Dark wood paneling, leather chairs, oil paintings
on walls.`,
    composition: `AI agent entering from the left doorway, silhouetted
against hallway light. Bankers arranged around a long oval table,
reacting with surprise. Camera at eye level. The room's traditional
decor (dark wood, portraits) contrasts sharply with the chrome robot.
Strong light-dark contrast at the doorway creates a dramatic entrance.`,
